Hi, I'm Semih Can Sancar. :)

Currently I am studying "MSc Computational Sciences" with an emphasis on molecular sciences at the Freie Univerit√§t Berlin. During my master's degree I studied a year abroad at the Universitat de Barcelona/Universitat Politecnica de Catalunya, where I attended modules of the master program "Atomisitic and Multiscale Computational Modelling for Physics, Chemistry and Biochemistry".
You can find some of the coding exercises here in my github repositories. I focus mainly on modelling and simulating molecular/cellular problems with Python.

I am very interested in combining life science problems with computer science methods such as Machine Learning. A first introduction into Deep Learning was presented during my master studies.
My goal is to deepen my knowledge in this topic and learn more about it. 

You can find me under my full name on LinkedIN if you want to reach me.
